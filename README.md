<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)


An ecommerce web application is an online platform that facilitates buying and selling products or services over the internet. It enables businesses to showcase their offerings to a global audience, allowing customers to browse, select, and purchase items conveniently from their devices. The web app typically includes features such as product listings, detailed descriptions, images, and prices. It also incorporates a secure shopping cart system that lets users add multiple items before proceeding to checkout.

Ecommerce web apps offer various benefits, including 24/7 accessibility, personalized shopping experiences, and a wide range of payment options. They often include search and filter functionalities to help users quickly find what they're looking for. Additionally, these apps may integrate with inventory management systems to ensure accurate stock information.

An innovative ecommerce web application that seamlessly connects buyers and sellers. It offers an intuitive user interface and personalized recommendations. With a wide range of products, a streamlined checkout process, and responsive design, it provides a convenient and enjoyable online shopping experience.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
